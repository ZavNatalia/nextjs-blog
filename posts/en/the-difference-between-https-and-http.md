## HTTP and HTTPS

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is a protocol or a set of rules that defines communication between a client and a server. When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, which then responds with an HTTP reply. The web server and your browser exchange data in plain text. In short, HTTP is the fundamental technology that enables web communication.

**HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)** is a secure version or extension of HTTP. With HTTPS, the browser and the server establish a secure encrypted connection before exchanging data.

## How Does HTTP Work?

HTTP is an application-layer protocol within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network model. It defines various request and response types. For example, if you want to retrieve data from a website, you send an **HTTP GET** request. If you need to submit information, such as filling out a contact form, you send an **HTTP POST** request.

Similarly, the server responds with different HTTP status codes and data. Here are some examples:

- **200** – OK
- **400** – Bad Request
- **404** – Resource Not Found

This request-response interaction happens behind the scenes for users. It is the fundamental way browsers and web servers communicate, ensuring the World Wide Web functions smoothly.

## How Does HTTPS Work?

HTTP transmits unencrypted data, meaning information sent from the browser can be intercepted and read by third parties. This lack of security led to the development of HTTPS, which improves the security of web interactions. HTTPS combines HTTP requests and responses with **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security)** technologies.

HTTPS websites must obtain an **SSL/TLS certificate** from a **Certificate Authority (CA)**. These websites send the certificate to the browser, which then verifies it and establishes trust. The SSL certificate also contains cryptographic information, enabling the server and browsers to exchange encrypted data. Here’s how the process works:

1. You open an HTTPS website by entering a URL in the format **https://** in your browser’s address bar.
2. The browser attempts to authenticate the website by requesting the server’s SSL certificate.
3. The server responds with an SSL certificate containing a public key.
4. The SSL certificate verifies the server’s identity. If the browser is satisfied, it encrypts and sends a message containing a session key using the public key.
5. The web server decrypts the message with its private key, retrieves the session key, encrypts it, and sends a confirmation message to the browser.
6. Both the browser and web server now use the same **session key** for secure communication.

## What Is the Difference Between HTTP/2, HTTP/3, and HTTPS?

The original version of HTTP, released in 1996–1997, was known as **HTTP/1.1**. **HTTP/2** and **HTTP/3** are improved versions of the protocol designed for efficiency. For example, **HTTP/2** exchanges data in a binary format instead of text, allowing servers to push responses to client caches proactively instead of waiting for new HTTP requests. **HTTP/3** builds on HTTP/2 to further improve efficiency, particularly for real-time streaming and modern data transmission needs.

**HTTPS, on the other hand, prioritizes security in HTTP communications.** Modern systems typically use **HTTP/2 with SSL/TLS** as HTTPS. As **HTTP/3 evolves**, browser and server technologies will eventually integrate it into HTTPS as well.

## Why Choose HTTPS Over HTTP?

Below are some key benefits of **HTTPS** over **HTTP**:

#### **Security**

HTTP messages are sent as plain text, making them easy to intercept and read by unauthorized entities. In contrast, HTTPS encrypts all transmitted data, ensuring that **sensitive user information (such as credit card details and personal data) remains secure**.

#### **Trust and Credibility**

Search engines often rank **HTTPS websites higher** than HTTP pages because HTTPS is more trustworthy. Users also prefer HTTPS websites, as browsers display a **padlock icon** in the address bar to indicate a secure connection. This added layer of security builds **trust and credibility** for businesses and websites.

#### **Performance and Analytics**

**HTTPS websites load faster** than HTTP websites. Additionally, **referral tracking works better with HTTPS**. Referral traffic—visits from external sources such as advertisements or social media backlinks—is more accurately tracked when using HTTPS. If you want **precise website analytics**, enabling HTTPS is essential.

## Is HTTPS More Expensive to Set Up Than HTTP?

**HTTPS requires obtaining and maintaining an SSL/TLS certificate** on your server. In the past, most Certificate Authorities charged an **annual fee** for registration and certificate maintenance. However, this is no longer always the case.

Many organizations now offer **free SSL certificates**. For example, **Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**, which issues, manages, and deploys **SSL/TLS certificates**. These certificates can be used with AWS services and private resources. ACM eliminates the **manual process of obtaining, uploading, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates**.
