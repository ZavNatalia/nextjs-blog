## **What is Web3?**

Web3 is a broad term for technologies like blockchain that decentralize ownership and data management on the Internet. Most internet applications are controlled by centralized organizations that determine how they store and use end-user data. Unlike centralized governance structures, Web3 technologies (also called Web 3.0, the decentralized web, or the semantic web) enable **community-driven projects**. In these projects, end users control their own data, set pricing, contribute directly to technical development, and play a larger role in shaping the project's direction. These technologies include **mechanisms for automatically regulating user interactions**, eliminating the need for centralized entities to manage them.

## **What are the core ideas behind Web 3.0?**

Web 3.0 is defined by four key characteristics.

### **Decentralization**

Decentralized web applications are a key feature of Web 3.0. The goal is to distribute and store data in **decentralized networks**. In these networks, multiple organizations own the underlying infrastructure, and users pay **directly** to storage providers for access.

Decentralized applications also replicate information across multiple locations, ensuring data consistency. Each user can **independently control where their data is stored** rather than relying on centralized infrastructure. In a decentralized web, users could even choose to **sell their data** if they wish.

### **Trustless Principle**

In centralized web applications and services, users often rely on a central authority to manage data, process transactions, and mediate interactions. These central authorities control user data and can manipulate system rules. This makes data susceptible to **security breaches** or **mismanagement**, potentially leading to **data loss or misuse**.

Web3 **removes the need for trust** in centralized entities. Users can participate in **transactions and interactions without having to trust a specific party**.

### **Semantic Web**

Through the **semantic web**, applications can execute **complex tasks** by analyzing the **content and context** of web data. The semantic web leverages **metadata** and **artificial intelligence** to interpret and provide meaning to user-provided data.

Web 3.0 aims for a **full transition** to semantic web technologies, some of which are already present in modern web applications. For example, search engines now provide **more accurate and contextually relevant search results**, while **AI assistants** help users complete tasks efficiently.

### **Interoperability**

Web 3.0 envisions a **seamless connection** between different technologies, allowing **data to move across platforms without intermediaries**. With interoperability, users can transfer their data, **switch between services easily**, and retain their profiles and settings.

At the same time, **Internet of Things (IoT) protocols** extend the network beyond traditional boundaries. For instance, **blockchain-based technologies** enable **borderless transactions**, allowing users to exchange value across geographic and political boundaries.

## **Why is Web 3.0 important?**

When the internet first emerged, most web services operated in a **read-only** format. Users could **only consume content**, which was published by companies that owned and maintained the infrastructure for **static web pages**.

With Web 2.0 technologies such as blogs and social media platforms, applications became **interactive**. Users could **create and share content**, but all interactions were regulated by **centralized platforms**. These platforms **profit from user-generated content** and often own **digital assets created by users**.

For example, **freelance platforms** connect workers with clients, while **rental platforms** link property owners with tenants. Service providers and users **submit data**, such as **profiles, service descriptions, blogs, videos, and comments**, but **platforms retain full control** over this data.

### **Problems with Web 2.0**

While centralized platforms **facilitate** interactions, Web 2.0 introduces several **problems**:

- Service providers **cannot transfer their data** to other platforms without **losing their business reputation and client base**.
- Users **do not control how their data is used** or managed.
- Platforms have the **power to filter user content**, restrict **access to certain features**, or even **ban users entirely**.

### **Advantages of Web 3.0**

Web 3.0 shifts towards a **read/write/own** paradigm. Creators retain **ownership** of their data, **control** how it is used, and **influence** how it is managed.

Here are some key advantages:

- **Greater User Engagement**: Users interact **more meaningfully** with services and each other, incentivized by **active participation** rather than passive data exchange.
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Users control **who can access their data**, and **platform owners cannot view it**. Your **online actions** may be public, but your **identity remains private**.
- **Democratized Communication**: Web 3.0 aims to **remove corporate, geographic, and political barriers** in communication. It minimizes **big tech censorship** and balances **security with transparency**.

## **What are the core technologies behind Web 3.0?**

Many Web 3.0 applications rely on **blockchain technology**, which provides **transparency, immutability, and a trustless framework**. Blockchain is a **decentralized** and **distributed ledger** that records **transactions or data** across a network of nodes.

In a **blockchain database**, data is stored in **chronologically linked blocks**. These blocks **cannot be altered or deleted** unless **the entire network reaches a consensus**. This ensures an **immutable and tamper-proof** system for recording transactions.

Here are other **key technologies** behind Web 3.0:

## **Tokenization**

Tokenization extends **blockchain technology** by representing real-world and digital assets as **tokens**.

Tokens act as **cryptographic representations of ownership** or access rights. They can represent **real estate, stocks, goods, art, music, or even in-game assets**.

Tokens can be divided into **securities tokens** (regulated financial instruments) or **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**, which represent **unique, indivisible assets**.

## **WebAssembly (Wasm)**

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a **binary instruction format** for a stack-based virtual machine. It runs **inside the browser’s isolated environment**, preventing access to the user’s **local file system**.

Wasm enables **high-performance execution** in web applications, making **Web3 dApps (decentralized applications) faster and more efficient**.

## **Semantic Web Technologies**

Semantic web technologies help applications **better understand and interpret data**. They enable **structured and linked data models**, making information **machine-readable**.

Examples include:

- **Resource Description Framework (RDF)**: Uses **triples** (subject-predicate-object) to define relationships between entities.
- **Web Ontology Language (OWL)**: Defines **classes, properties, and instances** to model knowledge and infer new insights.

## **What are some examples of Web 3.0 applications?**

### **Smart Contracts**

Smart contracts are **self-executing contracts** with predefined rules **written in code**. They **automatically enforce agreements** when **conditions are met**.

For example, a smart contract could **automate mortgage payments, bonds, or securities trading**, eliminating intermediaries and improving security.

### **Decentralized Identity**

Decentralized identity solutions give users **control over their digital identities**.

Instead of relying on **social media logins**, users create **decentralized identifiers (DIDs)** that **store personal credentials privately** while allowing **selective disclosure** when needed.

### **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)**

IPFS is a **peer-to-peer file storage system** that **eliminates the need for centralized servers**. Each file is assigned a **cryptographic hash**, ensuring **decentralized and resilient** content delivery.
